    <string name="info_section_transportation">There is a public transport card which is called M贸bilis:\nThe M贸bilis Card (Tarjeta M贸bilis) is a unique personalised card which you can use for the metro, bus and valenbisi. In other words: it\'s the only rechargable card for all public transport in Valencia. You can buy a M贸bilis Card at the tobacconists, newsagents and metro stations (but not at a ticket machine!).\nOn this card you can charge your metro and bus rides. If you charge the Mobilis Card with several rides at once using the Bonobus and Bonometro package you can save money.\nYou can see all the information <a href="https://www.emtvalencia.es/ciudadano/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=133&amp;Itemid=68&amp;lang=en">here</a></string>
